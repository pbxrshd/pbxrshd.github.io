 See Peter Drucker's new book, The Essential Drucker, for a thoughtful chapter on "the information executives need today."
 That is, you should start by considering the intellectual problems that the displays are supposed to help with.
 The point of information displays is to assist thinking; therefore, ask first of all:
  What are the thinking tasks that the displays are supposed to help with?

Entity (SKU/Product/Event/Airline Route) Monitoring -
 Is a particular product being targeted? Has something low risk now turned high risk?
 Profile Builder can monitor, in real-time, summarized fraud rates at the product/SKU level, across airline route networks, at events/locations, against a specific artist or genre,
 or similar entities,
Customer Affinity (Loyalty) -
  Are they purchasing a product or exhibiting a behavior that could increase their affinity for your brand?
   Leverage Profile Builder to identify real-time demographics, spend metrics, and purchase habits.
   Whether it is a first-time purchaser or a repeat buyer, reward the customer by creating customized programs such as discounting, cross-selling/up-selling, surveying, etc.
Spot changes in purchasing behavior – compare current transaction value to historical purchase values; digital content versus physical content; different city pairs for travel; different types of events for ticketing
By leveraging real-time aggregated data – IP address, Device ID, spending habits, email, phone number, physical address and more, Profile Builder can ascertain anomalous patterns and changes from the customer’s normal activity to create automated alerts

 - explore relationships, looking to get understanding between dynamics of data reln
 - self service discovery
 also has report dataunderlying

   fraud rate current / last week
   allows quick testing of hypotheses
   then can identify which needs deeper analysis

when dealing with multivariate data, effective
might seem like information overload, but to the trained eye these are invaluable

of course, also just the eye candy value


i want to be the data engineer building the tools for the data scientist
we are building a platform tht will serve the needs of data scientists
go beyond just providing a amatuer toolkit. i'm talking about a fully equipped machine shop
that willbe our competitive advantage, they don't have to invest in building a backend analytics themselvs
